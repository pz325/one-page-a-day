\paragraph{}
\begin{itemize}
    \item $b+b+b+b\times b$ can be simply written as (~~~~~~~~)
    \item In a triangle, if $\angle 1=a^{\circ}$ and $\angle 2=b^{\circ}$, then $\angle 3=$ (~~~~~~~~).
    \item In an isosceles triangle, if the base angle is $a^{\circ}$, the degree of the vertex angle is (~~~~~~~~)    
    \item When the sum of three consecutive even number is $a$, then the number in the middle is (~~~~~~~~), the least number is (~~~~~~~) and the gratest number is (~~~~~~~~)
    \item Use expressions with letters to represent the relations between quantities.
